# AI Voice Trainer

## Overview

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect specific exercises and count the number of repetitions performed. It's designed to help users monitor their exercise routines and ensure proper form.

## Features

- **Exercise Detection**: The script can detect specific exercises using computer vision.
- **Repetition Counting**: It counts the number of repetitions performed for each exercise.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on exercise form and repetition count.
- **Requirements File**: A `requirements.txt` file is included to easily install the necessary libraries.
- **Voice Recognition**: Provides exercise instructions using voice commands.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Offers real-time feedback on the user's emotions during exercise.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed
- The required libraries installed (see the `requirements.txt` file)
